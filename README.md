# 🛍 Katsu Shop 🛍

Static pages integrated using HTML and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Wireframes have been previously done in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4YqxUdrmg6rx2v9wJZerhB/Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1).

## 🛠 How to install

You'll need Node and NPM, then clone the repo and install the dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cestle18/katsu-shop.git
npm install
```


You can now open the file using your favorite browser!

:warning: The output of Tailwind is purged to limit the bundle size. Therefore you'll need to regenerate the css on change using:
```shell
npm run tailwind
```

## 📄 Pages

The idea was to integrate the main pages of an e-commerce website. We decided to go for the login, home, product, cart, checkout and order confirmation pages.

### 🔑 Login

We decided to go for a minimal design : center panel with two inputs for the credentials. The CTAs are highlighted using our primary color: pink.

### 🏠 Homepage

### 👕 Product page

### 🛒 Cart

### 💰 Checkout

### ✅ Order confirmation 

## Final words
